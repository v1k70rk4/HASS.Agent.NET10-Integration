## Description

This <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io" target="_blank">Home Assistant</a> integration is the second-half of <a href="https://github.com/v1k70rk4/HASS.Agent-Integration" target="_blank">HASS.Agent</a>, a Windows-based Home Assistant client.

All communication is done through MQTT. It supports auto discovery, so you'll see your HASS.Agent devices show up automatically in the integrations page:
